# OpenFPGA_ZX-Spectrum
OpenFPGA Port of the MiSTER Spectrum Core to Analogue Pocket

Original here https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/ZX-Spectrum_MISTer.git

Core requires the file boot.rom to be copied to Assets\zxspectrum\dave18.ZXSpectrum\boot.rom.  This is a consolidated rom file and is not provided. 

### boot.rom Structure

boot.rom is a collection of required ROMs, however it does not contain a full set of ROMs for each supported machine and/or hardware, it only includes the necessary subset.

### Pocket specfic features

USB keyboard support - plug a USB keyboard into the Analogue Dock and it drives the Spectrum keyboard matrix directly. F1-F11 and Ctrl/Shift/Alt work as documented below.

USB mouse support - plug a USB mouse into the Analogue Dock for Kempston Mouse emulation. Enable it in the "Mouse:" menu option (Kempston L/R or Kempston R/L to swap the left/right buttons). Driven directly from the Dock's mouse report - see `src/fpga/core/mouse.v`.

Independent Player 1 / Player 2 Joystick type selectors (Start menu) - each of the two attached controllers can be set to Kempston, Sinclair I, Sinclair II or Cursor independently, for genuine 2-player games. The menu won't let both players select the same type at once.

Key Mapped Joystick (P1) (allows Left, Right, Up, Down, A, B, X, Y, L Trig and R Trig on controller 1 to be mapped to keyboard keys) - now a separate on/off toggle rather than one of the Player 1 type choices, so it can be used alongside a Player 1 joystick type if desired.

- Note: if using a different joystick type X, Y, L Trig and R Trig will still function to allow for extra keys to be mapped

Border/Borderless video option

**Menu access is controller-only.** The following all read the attached
gamepad directly and have no USB keyboard equivalent - a docked keyboard
cannot open, close, or navigate any of them:

- **Select** - this core's own on-screen virtual keyboard overlay (very
  basic for now - A press key, X toggle shifts)
- **Start** - this core's own on-screen menu (model select, tape/disk
  options, etc.)
- **L Trig & Start** - Pause/Unpause (warning: may crash your game, it
  just holds CPU clock cycles)
- **L Trig & Select** - Issue NMI
- The **controller's Home button**, which opens the *Analogue Pocket's own*
  system menu - this is where files (`.tap`/`.tzx`/`.dsk`/`.z80`/`.sna`
  etc.) actually get loaded. This isn't part of the core at all: the
  Pocket's firmware intercepts the Home button before it ever reaches the
  FPGA, so there is no signal the core could watch or forward even if it
  wanted to, and no keyboard shortcut can substitute for it. **Loading a
  game/tape file always requires a controller with a Home button**, USB
  keyboard or not.

From the USB keyboard itself, the following work directly (no controller
needed) via `src/fpga/core/keyboard.sv`'s F-key detection:

- F4-F8 (no modifier) - machine speed/architecture shortcuts
- F9 (no modifier) - Pause/Unpause
- Alt+F11 - cold reset
- Ctrl+F11 - warm reset
- Ctrl+Alt+F11 - shadow ROM reset (not on +3 models)



### Change Log

### Unreleased (this fork)

Added - Real USB keyboard support via the Analogue Dock. `src/fpga/core/keyboard.sv` decodes the USB HID report directly to the Spectrum matrix every cycle (no PS/2 intermediate step, no per-key state) - see `src/fpga/core/usbkbd/README.md` for the full architecture and what is and isn't reachable from the keyboard (menu access remains controller-only, see above).

Fixed - `Fn`/`mod` (F-key and modifier shortcuts) were declared as `wire` but driven procedurally from the OSD soft CPU, which would fail synthesis. They are now driven correctly and merged with the hardware-keyboard source.

Added - Independent Player 1 / Player 2 Joystick type selectors, replacing the old single shared Joystick option (which had unused, commented-out `cont2_key` wiring already sketched in - finished it properly instead). Each of the two attached controllers picks Kempston/Sinclair I/Sinclair II/Cursor independently; the two can never be set to the same type (enforced in the OSD menu itself). Key Mapped Joystick is now a separate on/off toggle for Player 1 rather than one of the shared type choices.

Added - Real USB mouse support via the Analogue Dock (Kempston Mouse). `src/fpga/core/mouse.v` was already vendored from the original MiSTer core but entirely unused/dead code, wired for a PS/2 mouse packet the Pocket port never had a source for. Rewired to take the Dock's mouse report (cont4_key/cont4_joy/cont4_trig, type 0x5) directly instead - no PS/2 packet format anywhere in the path, same approach as the keyboard work above. `mouse.v`'s accumulator runs on clk_74a (same reasoning as the keyboard bridge - this device is 92%+ ALM-full with little clk_sys margin to spare); the Kempston I/O-port address decode stays on clk_sys in `core_top.sv` since a Z80 I/O read needs to resolve within a few clk_sys cycles. The "Mouse:" menu option (Disabled/Kempston L/R/Kempston R/L) was already fully wired in the OSD firmware from before; only the RTL side needed connecting.

### v0.7.0-beta

Reverted to a version of the MiSTER SDRAM controller but adapted to AGG23's timings to fix compatability with Turbo modes

Added - New Tape menu

Added - Tape Pause/Prev/Next options

Fixed - Tape sound on/off not working

Fixed - Kempston inputs still active while Virtual Keyboard displayed

Fixed - Auto-typing of LOAD ""

### v0.6.0-beta

Changed SDRAM to AGG23's version to fix timings on some Pockets

### v0.5.0-beta

Fixed sound output (signed rather than unsigned output)

Fixed - NMI shortcut using Left Shoulder + Select

Added - Optional disk LED indicator

and more changes to timing constraints to improve compatability across devices

### v0.4.0-beta

Fixed General Sound Hardware

Adjusted timing contraints to (hopefully) fix issues some people were experiencing

### v0.3.0-beta

Added disk drives

Added DivMMC 

Added Multiface 128

Added NMI

Added Quick Model Select

Added additional reset options

Change: Virtual Keyboard allows to hold Shift (X Button toggles)

Change: ROM Structure has changed to incorporate DiVMMC (0x0000 to 0x2000 can be left as zeros if DivMMC emulation not required).


### v0.2.0-alpha

Improved pause function (aligns with rising edge of cpu clock to avoid (hopefully) crashes).  Sound is muted when paused.

Sub-directories (Cores/Assets/Platforms) now start with capital letter

Core name changed from 'ZX Spectrum 48K' to 'ZX Spectrum'


### v0.1.0-alpha

All hardware features implemented except disk drives and DivMMC

- Note: I haven't tested General Sound as I haven't yet found a non-TRD file that uses it!



### TODO
Save States

Save per game Config



### Aspirations

Dock mode


### Note:

On my machine (AMD Ryzen 7 5800X) I have to restrict Quartus to a single core (set_global_assignment -name NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS 1) otherwise it crashes with Access Violation errors.  Annoying as it takes longer to build but I'm using v18.1 as per the APF framework so maybe it's a big buggy running on multiple cores.
